Input:

    A Regular expression R over the alphabet {0, 1}.
    R can contain the following operations: '*', '.', 'U'.

    The input should be (R). Keep the expression in parentheses. Example: ((1)*01(0)*)

    A string w ∈ {0, 1}

Output:

    “True” if w ∈ L(R); “False” otherwise.

How to run:

    1. Create an input file "input.txt"
    2. Enter the regular expression in the first line.
    3. In the next line, enter the string you want to check. Example: 111010000
    4. Run the java file with "input.txt" as a parameter. On your terminal, run the following commands.
        i. Command 1: javac RegularExpressionChecker.java
        ii. Command 2: java RegularExpressionChecker input.txt
